title: Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Me
description: Recently, I changed my name. In the words of Douglas Adams, “this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.” This talk is a look at how sometimes when we are designing systems, we don’t think about every possible way in which they are going to be used—and how not thinking about that can have unintended but very negative consequences on the people we intend to use them.

Recently, I changed my name. In the words of Douglas Adams, "this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." This talk is a look at how sometimes when we are designing systems, we don't think about every possible way in which they are going to be used --- and how not thinking about that can have unintended but very negative consequences on the people we intend to use them.

This talk is based on my article [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Me]({% link _posts/2017-05-04-falsehoods.md %}), which I published shortly after changing my name.
