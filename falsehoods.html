<h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px">Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Me</h1>
<p class="byline">by <a href="/">Skylar MacDonald</a></p>
<p class="lead">I'm sure we're all aware of the excellent article <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/" target="_blank">Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</a> by Patrick McKenzie. It's a wonderful list of everything that programmers assume when designing systems that handle names.</p>
<p>I <a href="{% link faq.html %}">changed my name recently</a>, so I've had the fun of updating my name on every system that knows who I am. To add additional complications to the process, my new last name is Scottish Gaelic (MacDhòmhnaill), and I go by both Skylar and Skye. Here is what I specifically have had to deal with so far.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of these points will be the same as points from Patrick's article, which was published seven years ago?</p>
<ol>
	<li>My name is not going to change. (Oops.)</li>
	<li>OK, names can change, but email addresses <em>never</em> change, right?</li>
	<li>OK, fine, email addresses can change, but I'll <em>never</em> need to change my username, surely?</li>
	<li>I have only changed my last name.</li>
	<li>I have only changed my first name.</li>
	<li>I have not changed my middle names.</li>
	<li>I have the same number of names as I did before.</li>
	<li>Both my first and last names are one uppercase letter followed by a series of lowercase letters.</li>
	<li>I am going to capitalise my name the same way every time I type it into anything.</li>
	<li>My full name can be rendered in ASCII.</li>
	<li>You think you know how to spell MacDonald/MacDhòmhnaill better than I do.</li>
	<li>MacDonald and McDonald are the same, right?</li>
	<li>Scottish Gaelic is the same as Irish Gaelic.</li>
	<li>My name is in a language other than English, so I must also speak that language.</li>
	<li>You assume MacDonald is what it says on my ID, because that's the name I've given you.</li>
	<li>You assume I go by MacDhòmhnaill, because that's what's on my ID.</li>
	<li>You assume that, even though I've told you &ldquo;MacDhòmhnaill is on my ID but I go by MacDonald&rdquo;, it'll be basically fine if you just use MacDonald/MacDhòmhnaill for everything.</li>
	<li><em>Your</em> system knows the difference between &lsquo;legal name&rsquo; and &lsquo;preferred name&rsquo;, so <em>everyone's</em> must.</li>
	<li>I have changed my name everywhere.</li>
	<li>I have changed my email address everywhere.</li>
	<li>I have changed my email address everywhere to the same thing.</li>
	<li>I <em>want</em> to change my name everywhere.</li>
	<li>I <em>want</em> to change my name everywhere <em>at the same time</em>.</li>
	<li>The name &lsquo;Skylar&rsquo; is a boy's name.</li>
	<li>The name &lsquo;Skylar&rsquo; is a girl's name.</li>
	<li>The name &lsquo;Skylar&rsquo; is at all gendered.</li>
	<li>The name &lsquo;Skye&rsquo; is at all gendered.</li>
	<li>Names are gendered.</li>
	<li>This name might not be gendered, but most names are, so you're going to have to pick a gender for this name.</li>
	<li>The fact that I've changed my name means I've changed my gender or pronouns.</li>
	<li>The fact that I've changed my name doesn't mean I've changed my gender or pronouns.</li>
	<li>The fact that I've changed my name means I've got married.</li>
	<li>The fact that I've changed my name means I've got divorced.</li>
	<li>OK, OK, fine, the fact that I've changed my name means that I'm in a civil partnership now?</li>
	<li>The title I've given you matches what I've put in the gender box on the form.</li>
	<li>You can't have an &lsquo;ò&rsquo; in a domain name.</li>
	<li>You <em>can</em> have an &lsquo;ò&rsquo; in a domain name without encoding it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode" target="_blank">punycode</a>. (You know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name" target="_blank">how IDN works</a>.)</li>
	<li>If you've encoded a non-ASCII character with punycode, problem solved&mdash;you don't need to display it in Unicode on the frontend.</li>
	<li>I'm going to remember to enter my email address in punycode.</li>
	<li>I'm going to remember that your system is smart enough to deal with Unicode and enter my email address <em>not</em> in punycode.</li>
	<li>I'm going to remember the punycode version of my name, and not have to look it up <em>every single time</em>.</li>
	<li>You operate a lot of different systems, sure, but they <em>all</em> know about punycode and IDN. Right?</li>
	<li>I've changed my name, so I must have changed my email address.</li>
	<li>I've changed my email address, so I must have changed my name.</li>
	<li>I've changed my personal details, so I must have changed my phone number too.</li>
	<li>I own <code>macdhòmhnaill.com</code>, so I must own <code>macdonald.com</code> as well.</li>
</ol>
