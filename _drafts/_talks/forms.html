title: How to Suck Less at Forms
description: Hi, I'm Skylar, and I like good UX and design. Or, perhaps more accurately, I get bugged by _bad_ UX and design. So, in this talk, I take you on a magical tour of web forms that suck, and give my (opinionated) take on why asking too many questions can lose your users before they even sign up.
