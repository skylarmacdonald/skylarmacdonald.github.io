As [I blogged about in June]({% link _posts/2024-06-16-emfcamp.md %}), I went to [Electromagnetic Field](https://emfcamp.org) this year, and did [a fun little talk about my day job]({% link _talks/how_to_save_a_life.md %}).

The video of that talk is now online and you can watch it if you want to know what I do all day.

It's also [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_88citi2T8) if you like YouTube.

That'll be all!
